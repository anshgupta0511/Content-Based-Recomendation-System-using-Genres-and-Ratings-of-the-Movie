Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Step 2: Taking input of movie names from user

Step 3: Conversion of user preferences into genre matrix 

Step 4: Dot product of user preferences' genre matrix with input rating and obtain user profile

Step 5: Multiply the genres with the user profile and then take the weighted average

Step 6: Give Recommendations of top 20 movies from dataset that match user's preferences the most!

This model works on simple dot product of genre and ratings of movies, I am still working on it to implement it using Pearson Correlation and K Nearest Neighbors(Cosine Similarity) for better accuracy of recommendation.
